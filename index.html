  <h3>About Me</h3>
<p id="first-para">I am Jeremy Pearce, a student at UB (University at Buffalo) and am majoring in computer science. Some things I enjoy doing are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>shooting</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I shoot skeet and trap for fun (sometimes competetively), and I target shoot when Call of Duty and Battlefield just aren't fulfilling.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>car spotting</li>
        <ul>
          <li>As a person who really loves cars, I also like just hanging around town and looking for cars (old and new).  I have no favorite car in particular because I like so many, but my favorite munfacturer is Koenigsegg.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>kickball</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It's not often that I can get enough people together for kickball, but when I can everyone has lots of fun.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>gaming</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I play games when I find it entertaining (sometimes its boring).  I really like FPS games that are either historical or revolve around modern themes, however I play many other kinds of games too.</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>
